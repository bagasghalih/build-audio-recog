# build-audio-recog
This is my first project using python programming language. In this case, I'll try to build my own "Speech Recognition" apps using any reference code that I've found on the internet. Enjoy!

NOTE:
1. This is is very premature project so, it may consists any problems or errors. So, I need you to Critizez my work and please give'em feedback!
2. This is not the API program so there are still many restriction to this program such as limited-language (just english)
3. You may find the problem while installinng the PyAudio libraries, so please pay attention to the installation of this libraries

THANKS YOU! :)
